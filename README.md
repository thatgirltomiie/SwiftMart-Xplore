- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation and cleaning
  - `numpy` – Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – Data visualization
  - `plotly` – Interactive plots
  - `missingno` – Missing data visualization
  - `datetime` – Time-based data parsing

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset provided by SwiftMart includes:

- Sales transactions (product, quantity, price, discount)
- Customer information (demographics, location)
- Date and time of purchases
- Product and category metadata

> Note: Due to confidentiality, the original dataset is not included in this public repository. A sanitized or synthetic sample dataset is provided for demonstration purposes.
